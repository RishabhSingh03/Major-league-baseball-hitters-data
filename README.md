# Major-league-baseball-hitters-data
This project applys and expands foundational data visualization skills in Python using real-world sports data.

Utilizing Major League Baseball hitters data, I analyzed and compared the distribution of batting averages, home runs v batting runs, top 10 home run hitters in 2022 and a correlation heatmap of batting statistics. This project allowed you to work with multi-dimensional data, combining spatial information (hit locations and trajectories) with numerical data (exit velocity, launch angle). The appropriate visualization types chosen to effectively represent this complex data, including scatter plots, heat maps, and possibly even 3D visualizations.

Additionally, working with sports data adds an element of storytelling, using visualizations to narrate the similarities and differences between the players' home run patterns.

Key data visualization skills learned and practiced by completing this project include:

Data cleaning and preparation of complex sports datasets
Crafting data-driven narratives through visual storytelling
Working with spatial data and geographic visualizations
Understanding different chart types, such as heat maps and scatter plots, and their appropriate uses.
